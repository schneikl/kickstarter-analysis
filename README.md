*Successful US theatre/play kickstarters have an average funding goal of around $5,000, while those failed have an average funding goal over $10,0000


# Recommendations
1 Launch your kickstarter campaign in May, as the data shows May and June are the two best months to run campaigns
2 Ensure your goal funding amount is as lean as possible, as successful campaigns average goals 1/2 the size of your projected goal
